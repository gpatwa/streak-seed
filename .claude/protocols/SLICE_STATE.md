# Protocol: Slice State

The slice-state file is the single source of truth for where a slice is in
the lifecycle. It lives at `runs/<slice-id>/STATE.md` in the product repo.
Any agent — or any fresh session — reads it to resume a slice cold, without
the originating conversation.

## Rules

- The Orchestrator creates `STATE.md` when a slice starts.
- Every agent **updates** `STATE.md` when it finishes its stage (before
  handing off).
- Never advance `Current stage` past a stage whose gate hasn't passed.
- Never advance past an open approval (see `APPROVAL_PROTOCOL.md`).
- Artefacts are referenced by path, never inlined.
- Alongside `STATE.md`, emit `runs/<slice-id>/trace.json` — machine-readable
  telemetry mirroring the Trace table (see "Machine-readable trace").

## Template

```markdown
# Slice State — <slice-id>

- **Ask:** <one-line human ask>
- **Project pack:** <archetype>
- **Release tier:** <1 / 2 / 3 / TBD>
- **Current stage:** <stage name>
- **Status:** <in-progress / blocked-on-approval / blocked-on-failure / done>
- **Started:** <UTC>  ·  **Updated:** <UTC>

## Stages

| Stage | Owner | Status | Artefact | Gate |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|------|
| Intake | Orchestrator | done | runs/<id>/00-slice-plan.md | n/a |
| Scope | Engineering Manager | in-progress | — | — |
| ... | ... | pending | — | — |

## Approvals

| Action | Rule | Requested | Decision | Approver | When (UTC) | Record |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| <action> | <HAR rule #> | yes | <approved/denied/PENDING> | <name> | <ts> | runs/<id>/APPROVAL_RECORD-*.md |

## Budget

Per `RUN_ECONOMICS.md`. Checked **before every spawn** — never reconciled after.

- **Budget:** <n>k tokens  ·  **Depth:** <smoke / standard / adversarial>
- **Spent:** <n>k (<pct>%)  ·  **Remaining:** <n>k
- **Next stage:** <stage> (<archetype>) est. <n>k → **<PROCEED / DEGRADE / STOP-AND-ASK>**

## Failure budget

Class per `FAILURE_LOOP.md` "Failure categories".

| Stage | Retries used | Cap | Class | Last failure |
|-------|--------------|-----|-------|--------------|
| <stage> | 0 | 2 | — | — |

## Interruptions

Per `RUN_ECONOMICS.md` §6. **Infrastructure** interruptions (usage limit,
transport error) are *not* retries and do not consume the failure budget;
**logic** failures do. On re-spawn, hand the agent its partial artefact back and
tell it to continue from the first missing section — never restart.

| Stage | Cause | Class | Partial artefact reached | Resumed |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------------------|---------|
| <stage> | <usage limit / transport / …> | infra \| logic | <last completed section, or "none"> | <yes/no> |

## Trace

One row per stage attempt — this is the pipeline's telemetry. Fill Tokens /
Tool calls from the harness's usage stats where available; wall-clock
always. Totals row = the slice's run cost. Feeds `PIPELINE_SLOS.md`.

| Stage | Model | Effort | Start (UTC) | End (UTC) | Wall | Tokens | Tool calls | Retry # |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| <stage> | <model> | <effort> | <ts> | <ts> | <m:ss> | <n> | <n> | 0 |
| **Total** | | | | | | <Σ> | <Σ> | |

Record the effort the stage **actually ran at**, not the frontmatter
default — tier and failure escalation both move it (`MODEL_ROUTING.md`).
Without this column a routing change cannot be evaluated after the fact.

## Next action

<one line: the very next thing to do — what a resuming session executes>
```

## Machine-readable trace

Alongside `STATE.md`, each run emits **`runs/<slice-id>/trace.json`** — the same
per-stage telemetry as the Trace table, machine-readable, so analytics can
aggregate across runs without parsing markdown. STATE.md stays the human mirror;
neither is hand-parsed for numbers.

```json
{ "schema": "agentic-sdlc/trace@2", "slice": "<id>", "tier": 2,
  "overlay": false, "landed": true, "started": "<UTC>",
  "operator": "<who drove this run>",
  "gateCatches": [ { "gate": "<QA|Security|...>", "verdict": "fail",
                     "severity": "<blocker|required-fix|advisory>",
                     "finding": "<one line: what it caught>" } ],
  "stages": [ { "stage": "<name>", "executor": "subagent",
               "model": "<model>", "effort": "<level>",
               "tokens": 0, "toolCalls": 0, "retries": 0 } ] }
```

**`gateCatches`** records every defect a gate caught before it shipped — the
closest thing this system can honestly produce to an *impact* number. A gate
that fails a slice and sends it back is the pipeline earning its keep; counting
those catches, by gate and severity, is how the qualitative evidence ("QA
failed browser-client on a live a11y defect", "Security blocked the http-layer
bind") becomes a metric. Omit the array when nothing was caught; a genuinely
clean slice recording `[]` is different from an old run that never recorded it.

Pre-schema runs logged gate activity only in prose or an ad-hoc
`notes.gatesThatFired` array. `analyze.mjs` surfaces that legacy array too, so
existing catches aren't lost, but it labels the total a **floor** — a run whose
Security block lives only in its write-up cannot be counted structurally, so the
number under-reports until every run emits `gateCatches`.

**`operator`** names the human who drove the run. A stage may carry its own
`operator` when a different person drove that stage; otherwise it inherits the
slice's.

Recorded now, while it is one field on a young corpus, because attribution is
painful to retrofit and impossible to reconstruct. Every run to date was driven
by one person, so the field costs nothing today and is the prerequisite for
anything multi-operator later — per-person budgets, slice ownership, or knowing
who to ask about a run. `analyze.mjs` stays silent about it while a fleet has a
single operator, and breaks figures out per operator once it has more.

**`stages` must list every stage that ran** — including ones the Orchestrator
executed itself rather than spawning. Mark those `"executor": "orchestrator"`;
`model`, `effort`, `tokens`, and `toolCalls` may be omitted when there is no
telemetry to report.

This is what `trace@2` fixes. Under `trace@1`, `stages` in practice meant
"stages spawned as subagents", and self-executed stages were dropped — or
recorded in an ad-hoc `notes.orchestratorExecuted` array that no tool read and
no schema described. Three of the first eight runs are in that state, so every
cost, density, and DORA figure for them was computed over a partial list with
nothing saying so.

`analyze.mjs` accepts both schemas and reports untraced stages either way — old
traces are run records and are not rewritten. What changes going forward is
that the omission is **structural and visible** instead of ad-hoc and silent:
a slice cost that excludes untraced stages is now reported as a floor.

The Post-Launch agent regenerates `runs/ANALYTICS.md` + `runs/dashboard.html`
from all traces via `execution/analyze.mjs` at slice close.

## Status values

- **in-progress** — a stage is actively running.
- **blocked-on-approval** — a human-approval gate is open; the run is
  paused and MUST NOT proceed (see `APPROVAL_PROTOCOL.md`).
- **blocked-on-failure** — a gate failed and the retry budget is spent;
  escalated to the human (see `FAILURE_LOOP.md`).
- **done** — the slice landed and Post-Launch is complete.
